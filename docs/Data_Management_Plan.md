# Data Management Plan

##Data Description
We will conduct a series of field studies and collect numeric data from field and lab measurements (plant height, plant metal content). Plant Metadata (botanical name, family, plot ID, site name) will be included together with field pictures, pXRF spectroscopy images and hyperspectral data. 

##Data Collection
For plant metal content, the data is collected by the portable XRF, saved to SD card and then the data is pulled off and exported to .csv format. Pictures are taken by camera and then extracted to the designated folder.

##Data Storage and Backup
Data can currently be pulled from 4 different locations - OneDrive, Laptop memory, Sharepoint, Email history. 

##Data Organization and Documentation
Project specific folder structure will be created to propely document all project files. Readme file will be included to introduce the data. 

##Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
To assure longer-term sustainability of the data, it will  reside on CyVerse Data Storage and Zenodo. 

##Data Sharing and Access
Upon publishing, the data will be available open access under creative commons 0 licence. Data will also be available with a link.

##Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
The data will be collected from the legacy mine site at the close proximity to residential site. The disclosure of the data will depend upon the agreement from the mining company. Data ethics may be considered if data won't be published, and the tailings site pose a health risk to local communities. 

##Roles and Responsibilities
A doctoral student will have a primary responsibility for data standards, long-term data archiving, and physical database hosting. Upon graduation, the project PI will take over.  

##Budget and Resources
Data storage and management will be conducted via open source platforms and platforms provided to University employees with paid subscription.
